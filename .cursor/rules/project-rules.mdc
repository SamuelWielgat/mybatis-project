# Project Goal
Build a minimal, modern Java 17 + Spring Boot 3.x project using MyBatis for persistence and PostgreSQL as the database.

# Stack and Tools
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.x
- MyBatis (XML-based mappers)
- PostgreSQL via Testcontainers (Docker-based, no manual DB setup)
- Spock + Groovy for testing
- Maven as build tool

# Features to Include
- Simple domain model: `User` entity with `id`, `name`, `email`
- Basic CRUD operations using MyBatis Mapper interfaces + XML
- `application.yml` configuration for PostgreSQL
- Integration testing using Spock and Testcontainers
- Clean, educational folder structure
- Minimal README with setup & run instructions

# Guidelines
- Focus on clarity and best practices
- Keep it simple but production-aligned
- Use Spring Initializr to generate project base

- Optimize for learning and clean code
